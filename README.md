My full name is Kishor Subbarayalu, you could call me as Kishor.

I am an experienced Business Analyst with a demonstrated history of working over 3 years in a Backoffice application of an Investment bank using intermediary knowledge on SQL and Unix. Skilled in Requirements Gathering, build specifications and ability to sell the design. Very Good user of english and effective communicator to make strong impact on client business operations and strategic decisions. I enjoyed dealing with enormous datasets on a regular basis, which piqued my interest in discovering something about data. I feel that the MCDA programme at Saint Mary's University, together with my efforts over the following 16 months, will tremendously assist me in achieving my goal of working as a data analyst in the capital markets industry.

Technical expertise:

 -> Unix
 
I've worked on most parts of the Software Development Life Cycle, including requirements gathering, planning, functional design, testing, and deployment. This term's 5510 course, I believe, will provide the requisite exposure to software development tools and techiniques.
